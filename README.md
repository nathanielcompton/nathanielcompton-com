# Personal Website

http://nathanielcompton.com

This is the code for my personal website.<br>
It is my first attempt at front end design, implementing my growing knowledge of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

Future to-do:
- Update site to incorporate golang functionality
- Create database store to house blog, visitor data
- Improve user experience and on-site retention
